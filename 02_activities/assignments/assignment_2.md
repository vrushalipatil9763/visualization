# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    
     Visualization 1: I selected this visualization as a good example: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/bobby.kawade/viz/StockMarketAnalysisTechnologyStocks/StockMarketAnalysis
      ------------------------
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.
    
      ```
     
      This visualization is well-designed, user-friendly, and serves as a strong starting point for anyone exploring stock trends in the technology sector. Its clarity and simplicity are its greatest strengths. However, for more analytical audience, adding contextual annotations, benchmark comparisons, and a few additional metrics could improve it from a good descriptive tool to a more comprehensive analytical one. 

      1. The layout is intuitive and minimalist, with no visual clutter, making it easy for beginners to navigate.
      2. Interactive dropdown filters for stock selection and time range allow users to personalize their view and explore specific trends.
      3. The graph updates quickly in response to user inputs, providing a smooth and responsive experience.
      4. Ample white space keeps the focus on key visual elements without distraction.
      5. The ‚ÄúChange in Stock Price‚Äù graph is crisp, with effective color contrast to differentiate between stocks. Tooltips provide precise data (dates, prices), adding depth without overwhelming the viewer.
      6. Summary KPIs (such as overall percentage change) offer a quick overview of stock performance.

    - How could this data visualization have been improved?  
      ```
      1. The dashboard lacks a benchmark index (e.g., NASDAQ or S&P 500) for context. Adding a reference or comparison line would help users evaluate stock performance relative to the broader market.
      2. Including annotations for major events such as stock splits, earnings announcements, or significant tech news would provide valuable context for observed trends.
      ```


Visualization 2: I selected this visualization as a bad example: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/econreviews/viz/StockMarketsAnalysis/StockMarkets

    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.
      ```
      This visualization is not the worst, but it suffers significantly from a lack of clear communication and visual storytelling, making it a less effective representation of stock market data.
        1. All three maps use nearly identical layouts, making it feel repetitive without adding new value.
        2. A user has to look very closely to even understand what changed from one frame to the next.
        3. The world maps are used for showing stock market metrics, but country-level mapping doesn‚Äôt enhance understanding of these metrics.
        4. You can't click on a country to get more details, or filter by region, or select a time range.
        5. This severely limits user engagement and insight.
        6. There are no labels, no legends that clearly explain what high/low colors mean, and no tooltips with exact data on hover.
        7. No background or interpretation is provided, so the user is left guessing.
        8. Country shapes are too small in some regions (e.g., Europe), making it hard to distinguish differences.
        9. There‚Äôs no title explanation for what time period is used for returns or volatility.

      ```


    - How could this data visualization have been improved?  
      ```
      1. The terms "return" or "volatility" could be better represented as a bar chart, heatmap, or scatter plot, where comparisons are clearer.
      2. Enable users to hover over countries for detailed tooltips (e.g., exact values).
      3. Include filters or dropdowns to allow exploration by time period or region.
      4. Include titles or subtitles that specify what each map shows and for which time period.
      5. Add a legend that clearly explains the color gradient.
      6. Avoid redundant visuals; if using three maps, they must offer distinct and valuable views.

      ```



- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)
