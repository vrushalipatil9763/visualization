# Data Visualization for 

- For each visualization, describe and justify: 
    > What software did you use to create your data visualization?
    Tableau Public was used to create the data visualizations.
    This tool was chosen for its interactive capabilities, drag-and-drop interface, ease of data cleaning and integration (e.g., unioning sheets), and the ability to publish and share dashboards online.

    > Who is your intended audience? 
    The primary audience includes policymakers, social program analysts, researchers, and advocacy groups interested in understanding social assistance patterns in Ontario’s Census Metropolitan Areas (CMAs). The visualizations are also useful for the general public to gain insights into how social support systems are used over time and across demographics.
    
    > What information or message are you trying to convey with your visualization? 
    The dashboard conveys the following key messages:
    1. Single individuals form the largest share of social assistance recipients.
    2. ODSP cases are generally long-term (60+ months) and are increasing over time.
    3. Ontario Works cases show a declining trend in recent years in many urban areas.
    
    These findings aim to highlight usage patterns and potential gaps in support services.
    
    > What aspects of design did you consider when making your visualization? How did you apply them? With what elements of your plots? 
    - Used bar charts for clarity and easy comparison. 
    - Chose stacked bars to show category breakdowns and total values simultaneously.
    - Limited the use of colors to clearly distinguish between programs and family types while maintaining visual harmony across the dashboard.
    - Grouped the time axis by year to reduce visual clutter from quarterly data.
    - Adjusted labels, legends, and tooltips for better interpretability.
    - Used tiled layout to maintain a structured flow.
    - Positioned insights strategically to guide the viewer through the narrative.

   
    > How did you ensure that your data visualizations are reproducible? If the tool you used to make your data visualization is not reproducible, how will this impact your data visualization? 
    Tableau Public workbooks can be downloaded, and all data transformations were performed within Tableau, ensuring reproducibility.
    The source Excel file was clean and structured, making it easy for others to replicate the steps.
    
    > How did you ensure that your data visualization is accessible?  
    - Used high-contrast colors and legible font sizes. 
    - Avoided overloading charts with too many dimensions or small elements. 
    - Summarized insights with text bullets to help users with visual impairments or cognitive processing challenges.
    Additional accessibility improvements could include screen reader compatibility and alternative text descriptions.
    
    > Who are the individuals and communities who might be impacted by your visualization?  
    - Recipients of ODSP and Ontario Works, especially those living in urban Ontario.
    - Policy analysts and government agencies tasked with welfare planning.
    - Community organizations focused on social equity and public service delivery.
    
    > How did you choose which features of your chosen dataset to include or exclude from your visualization? 
    Included:
        Focused on Program Type, Family Type, and Duration for meaningful trends.
        Used CMA-level data to maintain scale consistency.

    Excluded:
        Left out Province-level sheets to avoid distortion.
    
    > What ‘underwater labour’ contributed to your final data visualization product?
    - Reviewed and prepped data across 4 sheets.
    - Learned Tableau unioning, formatting, and dashboard design.
    - Refined charts through trial and error. 
    - Analyzed and summarized insights clearly.
